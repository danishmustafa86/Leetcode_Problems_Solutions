// For a string sequence, a string word is k-repeating if word concatenated k times is a substring of sequence. The word's maximum k-repeating value is the highest value k where word is k-repeating in sequence. If word is not a substring of sequence, word's maximum k-repeating value is 0.
// Given strings sequence and word, return the maximum k-repeating value of word in sequence.
// Example 1:
// Input: sequence = "ababc", word = "ab"
// Output: 2
// Explanation: "abab" is a substring in "ababc".
function maxRepeating(sequence: string, word: string): number {
